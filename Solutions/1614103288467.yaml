label: L8304 bad -> no backlight, no image
description: >-
  Caused by Liquid Damage


  Original problem no backlight; DIY repair someone opened it and now no image,
  no backlight. Both failed components replaced -> both problems fixed.
  Backlight circuit will work for testing if C7782 is removed rather than
  replaced.
