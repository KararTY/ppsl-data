label: dirty between CB321 and heatshield
description: >-
  Caused by Component failure


  Capacitor CB300 is in a tight space  - needed to slightly bend metal shield
  out of the way. Removed CB300 with micro soldering pencil, but needed metal
  foil (as a heat shield over CB3215) and hot air station at 300 degrees to get
  new CB300 in place. Stopped hot air as soon as cap was in place to avoid
  melting solderballs under CB3215. Did not see the logic board part number in
  the video.
