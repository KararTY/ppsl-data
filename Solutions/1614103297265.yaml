  Caused by Liquid Damage, Bad Design


  Power button is integrated into the keyboard, so liquid damage to any part of
  keyboard can prevent power button from working. Short to ground on
  WS_KBD_ONOFF_L results in 'power button always pressed' fail state - computer
  thinks SMC being continuously reset and will never power on, with no fan spin
  and no power draw.
