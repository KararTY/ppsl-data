label: You think PPBUS_G3H is 8.55v
description: >-
  You measured the right side of the fuse, not the left side of the fuse,
  because you are right handed and keep the red probe of your multimeter in your
  right hand. Had you measured the left side of the fuse, you'd realize the fuse
  is blown, likely due to a short circuit.


  You are probably off in the wilderness, hunting why your PP3V3_S5 & PP5V_S5
  are missing, before you even have PPBUS_G3H... We've all been there.
