label: Corrosion around thunderbolt ROM chip (UB090) - two resistors replaced
description: >-
  Caused by Liquid Damage


  Two corroded resistors between USB-C chip and thunderbolt ROM chip (UB090)
  where replaced: (1) RB290: 100ohm resistor on TBT_T_SPI_CLK_DBG line (not a
  cause of problem - device should work fine without it); (2) RB090: 3k3 pull-up
  resistor to PP3V3 on TBT_T_ROM_HOLD_L line (ROOT CAUSE)
