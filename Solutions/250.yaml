label: Bad trace between R7186 and adjacent probe point

  Caused by Bad trace


  20mA power draw and 1.1V on PPBUS_G3H. The trace from R7186 to the ISL (U7100)
  was ok, trace from R7186 to its adjacent probe point bad. This is almost
  invisible and is rare (Louis had not seen this exact issue before.) Replaced
  trace with a wire -> fixed.
