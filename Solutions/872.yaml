label: 200KOhm resistor for voltage divider backlight enable bad
description: >-
  Caused by Liquid Damage


  Bad 200KOhm resistor from voltage divider for backlight output enable (next to
  LED driver chip U9701)

  (liquid damage, lots of corrosion cleaned, first problem was flickering
  backlight, also not turning on during repair)


  A lot of corrosion on the board cleaned with flux and ultrasonic, machine
  died, 200KOhm resistor for voltage divider of backlight output enable.
  Replaced -> fixed.
